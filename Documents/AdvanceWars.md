# Advance Wars

A turn-based military themed combat focused on capturing bases and destruction of opponent's units.

## Initial Thoughts

The `combination of units and synergy with terrain` made the combat experience unique and very interesting. Lots of opportunity for fun tactics and predicting your opponents. 

`Fog Of War` encourages more carful playstyles. The idea is based on gaining `vision control` over your opponents and in turn gaining map control. In contrast to clear map design, players play a more `precise` game. Without fog of war, the game would result in a `stalemate` where whichever player initiating the attack would appear lose. 

`Defensive playstyle encourages turtling` but eventually feels slow and difficult for games to end. 

## Unit Attributes

`Move` - Describes how far a unit can move

`Vision` - How much a unit can see through fog of war

`Firepower` - Raw damage against others

`Fuel` - How many spaces it can move before refueling

`Effectiveness` - Damage multipliers against different types of units

`Cost of Deployment` - How much income it takes to deploy a unit

## Pre-Game

One player gets to choose the map. Some maps are symmetrical however others are not which changes up each player's strategy. Some maps offer `water terrain` which allows players to build `ship ports`, changing up the strategies players can focus on. `Terrain changes move and vision` (increases/decreases) how far a unit can move and see. 

Players start by deploying units on their base. Deploying a `mix of units` allows players to `gain advantages in firepower, movement and vision`. Having `slow units deployed in the front` and `faster units in the back` allow the player to `support slow units` by `keeping all units within the same range of movement`.

Players can also change `building income` which affects the balance of the game. 

### Key Notes

Some units `benefit off terrains`. Terrains have different properties:
* Infantries have extra vision on top of mountains
* Roads increase the number of moves a unit can make
* Forest hides units

Capturing buildings `provide income` which is beneficial to out-resourcing your opponent.

## In-Game

Players can focus on `capturing buildings`, `offensive` and `defensive` strategies. 

### Initial Game Plan

One of the most important actions for a player is to `scout for vision`. Having a large range of vision allows a player to act first. The next step is to look towards `taking control of neutral buildings` for further income. 

### Waging War

Challenging units on `different terrains changes the amount of defense` units have. Engaging in battle first `allows a unit to deal damage to the opponent's unit before they retailiate`. Use your `infantry units to barricade your opponent's advancement` to protect your on artillery units. 

### Approaching

Gathering vision is important to approaching your opponent. `Having vision over your opponent` allows you to get first hits, challenging your opponents' frontliners. Breaking through those units allows you to `get close to your opponent's rockets` which are safe to contest at close range. 

`Chipping away at your opponent's vision` allows you to gain more first hit advantages while you move expensive units safely forward.
