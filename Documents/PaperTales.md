# Paper Tales

A team-building board game focused on winning wars, collecting resources and ultimately having the most points.

## Initial Thoughts

The combination of cards and structures make for an `endless number of possibilities`. Every game feels `unique` and `fun` to play. Playing combos are very satisfying. There are lots of `unique strategies` and card combinations which make the game feel diverse. 

`Luck` may be slightly too much of a factor to the game. Striking a balance between resources can `greatly influence your current turn as well as subsequent turns`. A bad start can be really detrimental to the game.

The game is balanced in a sense that `determining a strategy is based on how other people are playing` (you want to diverge from the norm).

## Pre-Game Analysis

Analysis on pre-game thoughts and strategies based on game setup.

### Randomized Structures

Players have the ability to strategize with the combinations of structures available with the game. Structures can support the power of your team, the income or take a resource-focused approach to gathering points throughout the game.

`Resource-Focused` - `Abbey` may take too long to setup, short on money, difficult to win wars against neighbouring players

`War-Focused` - Difficult to build structures without resources

#### Cards Combinations

Structure-focused strategies depend on a few key cards which boost the strategy

* `Landlord` - limited to 1
	* No landtax required
* `Manticore` - For meat game, (limited to 3)
	* Meat-focused high power unit
* `Princess` - limited to 1
	* Doubles all effects of buildings

## In-Game

Analysis on in-game thoughts and strategies based on what is already/being played.

### Adaptation

Some cards pertain to `flexible strategies` while others are `strictly appropriate to rare scenarios`. Generally the first turn defines how to play your strategy. Sometimes if cards don't work together, the most flexible structure to go for is the `Temple`. Having a strong combo start opens up `exotic buildings` which allows a player to snowball the game.

Generally, players pick `combo starters` or `rare cards` for their opening hands and make-do with the remaining cards they recieve. 

> Eventually a player decides on a strategy in which their cards will play out

### Resources

`Income` (in almost all games) is vital to the player. Having income opens up opportunities to building structures and playing strong units. 

`Wood/Meat/Gems` are combo-heavy resources which aren't important in certain strategies but can be very powerful when the cards are put together.

`Runes` are dependent on units which have special effects which activate when dead or while alive, having runes attached to them.

> Players should strike a balance between resources, having an overexcessive amount of one resource leads to wasting the unused resource.

### War

`War` is a situational concept which (in personal opinion) `should not be ignored` in any strategy. All strategies eventually `build up power` and allow players to win battles. Players need to `strike a balance` when `attempting to win wars` and `earning points through other resource means`.

Commiting to war `isn't about reaching the highest power`, but `consuming the least amount of resources needed to beat your neighbouring players`.
